# BigQuery
This repository contains an end-to-end SQL-based analytics project developed in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Google BigQuery.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to:

Write and optimize complex SQL queries,

Connect to cloud-based data warehouses (BigQuery),

Perform real-world analytical tasks on large-scale datasets,

Visualize aggregated metrics with Python libraries like matplotlib.

I used publicly available Google Analytics sample data and focused on analyzing transaction behaviors over different time dimensions (daily, weekly, monthly), and identifying top-performing product categories by revenue.

The notebook also includes proper authentication flow using a Google Cloud service account and is structured for easy understanding with explanatory comments and visual outputs.

ðŸ’¡ This project was developed to showcase my practical skills in SQL and data analytics in a cloud-based environment.
